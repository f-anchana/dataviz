# Evolutive and Interactive Data Visualization Project
This DataViz student project involves creating an interactive visualization of evolving data. In order to do this, we chose to illustrate the number of plays on Spotify of each Grammy Awards winning rap track. In this way, the user gets a better overview of the hits that may have topped the trends, as well as the rappers who contributed to them.
